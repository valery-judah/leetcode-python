# LeetCode Python Workspace Docs

Welcome to the project documentation site. This site is built with MkDocs and mkdocstrings.

- Project repo: <https://github.com/valery-judah/leetcode-python-project>
- Continuous Integration: see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

What you’ll find here:

- Problem write-ups (narrative READMEs) and step-by-step reasoning
- API references for solution classes via mkdocstrings (through import shims)

Run locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Deploy (via GitHub Actions → Pages) is already configured in the repo CI guidance.
