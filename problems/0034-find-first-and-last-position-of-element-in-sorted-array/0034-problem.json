After all, it seems like a straightforward approach, right? \\uD83E\\uDD14\\n\\nHowever, here\\'s where the plot thickens! \\n\\nGiven that the array is sorted, why not leverage this fact to your advantage and craft a logarithmic solution instead?  The term \"sorted\" practically whispers to you, suggesting the use of binary search. But how exactly do you wield this powerful technique?\\n\\n\\uD83E\\uDD14 Ah, here\\'s the twist! The main challenge arises when the element you\\'re looking for equals `nums[mid]`. Is it the first occurrence or the last? \\uD83E\\uDD37\\u200D\\u2640\\uFE0F That\\'s the million-dollar question right there.\\n\\n\\u2728 Now, here comes the magic trick! \\n\\nYou don\\'t just use one binary search; you utilize two of them. \\uD83E\\uDE84 Yes, you heard that right! \\n\\n One binary search is dedicated to finding the lower bound, and the other to discover the upper bound. \\n\\n\\uD83C\\uDFAF And just like that, you\\'ve transformed a seemingly complex problem into an elegant, efficient solution. Ta-da! \\uD83C\\uDF89\\u2728\\uD83D\\uDCAB",
