Make a stack and push index 0 in it  (because for index 0, we donot have any greater element right now)\\n2. Check for every index from 1 to n\\n3. If element less than this number is/are present in stack just keep on popping them and update in your answer array the difference in indexes of both of these (we want distance between index of these 2 numbers, right)\\n4. Push the index for which you were checking in the stack (bcoz we have not got any element greater than this element)\\n\\neg.  [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]\\n\\n We push 0 in stack\\nNow, we checked for index i = 1, its 74 and element less than it (73) is present in stack\\nSo, we did (ans [stk.top ()} = 1 - stk.top ()) (1 is i in this case)\\nNow, stack is empty and we add index 1 in stack bcoz we need to find the element greater than 74\\nNext, for i = 2, it will be the same procedure\\nnow, stack will have 2 (index of 75) after i = 2\\nNow, when we check for i = 3, i..e 71, we cant find any element greater than it in stack, so, we just push this index without popping anything\\nNow, after i = 3, stack has {71, 75} from top to bottom\\nNext, for i = 4 i.e. 69, we can see than only index 3 is greater than 69, so we pop index 3 and push the current index i.e. 4\\n\\nLike this, we will work till index n\\nAfter checking till end, if stack has any indexes left, the answers for them will be 0\\n\\nIf you guys wanna see the implementation\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/submissions/861460644/\\n\\nPlease UPVOTE\\n",
