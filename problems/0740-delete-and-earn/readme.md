- Function: `deleteAndEarn`
- Signature: `(nums: list[int])  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Dynamic Programming**

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
