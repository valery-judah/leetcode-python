# 1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-subarray-with-positive-product/)
- Function: `getMaxLen`
- Signature: `(nums: list[int])  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Greedy**

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1567"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.
Notice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [-1,-2] or [-2,-3].
```
