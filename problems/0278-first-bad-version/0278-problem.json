I am usually very careful about possible integer overflows, so when I was coding binary search I thought, \"Can it overflow?\", and then I thought \"No, we can't have that many versions in a real life scenario, so better use a simpler expression than the usual overflow-conscious one.\" And\\u2014voila!\\u2014it overflowed!\\n\\nBut really, 2126753390 versions? Even if you're making a new version every second, you still need *67 years* to produce that many. And even if you really do, it's a bad idea to use `int` to store version numbers in such case.\\n\\nP. S. As mentioned in the comments, there is a way to get both overflow-protected and concise expression for positive integers: `(left + right) >>> 1`. That's exactly what `Arrays.binarySearch` uses. So that makes this one test case for this problem very useful education-wise.",
