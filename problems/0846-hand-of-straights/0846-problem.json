Posting following 1 testcase where earlier expected answer was different than leetcode's testcase output\n\n**input = [8,10,12], groupSize=3**\n\nLeetcode testcase answer = false.\nEarlier I thought output should have been true\n\n**Why is output = false?**\n\nOne of the problem's condition is, groupSize = 3. There can be any number of group. So in above input, i can make 1 group of size=3 which is array itself [8,10,12]\n\nOther main condition is, numbers in groups should be consecutive i.e. nextNumber = prevNumber + 1 in each group.\nAbove condition is not satisfied as gap between number is greater than 1 and hence they are not consecutive.\n\n For answer to be true, possible inputs could have been [8,9,10] or [9,10,11] etc.",
