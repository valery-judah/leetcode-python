But that is not really a vertical order traversal. I mistakenly used dfs first to find out later in my answer the nodes in the same column were not arranged from top to bottom.\\n- LC 314: Vertical order traversal: from top to bottom in a column + If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right. TreeMap with horizontalDistance as key helped solving this.\\n- LC 987: Vertival Order traversal: from top to bottom in a column + If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be smaller value should come in first. TreeMap with horizontalDistance as key and value being \\'TreeMap with height as key and value being TreeSet for sorting by node value\\' helped solving this \\n\\nI came up with the solutions on my own. Go through my 1st accpeted submission for each question. There might be optimizations in LC solutions. I didnt look at it yet. Have a look some day when you get time.\\n\\n**Note: This is an application of Level Order Traversal**",
