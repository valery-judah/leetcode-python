AND SURPRISINGLY JUST AFTER INTERVIEW I GOT THIS QUESTION HERE ON LC Xd ! bc pehle nai mila \\n\\nanyway tip to solve this question \\n\\n1. sort the array and use a variable to store the minDiff and make a pair vector to store the result.\\n2. use abs() to get the absolute diff between numbers \\n3.  if mindiff >diff , update the value of mindiff to diff and clear all the previous pairs because you found the lowest diff now and push the numbers in pair vector.\\n4. also if mindiff == diff we have to push the numbers .(you will understand once you will start coding)\\n5.this is the part where i got stuck as i forgot how to use const and push pair vector data to a single vector .\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n",
