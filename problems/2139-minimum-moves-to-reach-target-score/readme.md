# 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-reach-target-score/)
- Function: `minMoves`
- Signature: `(target: int, maxDoubles: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Greedy**

## Constraints

- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- `0 <= maxDoubles <= 100`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2139"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: target = 5, maxDoubles = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: Keep incrementing by 1 until you reach target.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: target = 19, maxDoubles = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Initially, x = 1
Increment 3 times so x = 4
Double once so x = 8
Increment once so x = 9
Double again so x = 18
Increment once so x = 19
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: target = 10, maxDoubles = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: Initially, x = 1
Increment once so x = 2
Double once so x = 4
Increment once so x = 5
Double again so x = 10
```
