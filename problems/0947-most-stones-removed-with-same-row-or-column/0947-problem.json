      "content": "This question demonstrates overthinking. You can solve this question in an easy way or a hard way.\n\nFirst hard way, create an edge between two coordinates if they share a common x or y coordinate. Then, use union-find by size (not rank) and sum all the sizes. Return this sum. The reason we sum all the sizes is that if a coordinate shares a row or column, it is basically connected to the nodes. To make a node independent, we need to remove every node that is connected to this node.\n\nThis is the same as finding the number of connected components. By calculating the total nodes minus the number of connected components, we find the number of individual components that share a row or column with no other node.\n\nThis is where the easy method comes in using DFS. Find the number of connected components using DFS and then subtract the number of connected components from the length of the stones.",
