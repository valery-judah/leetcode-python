# 0117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)
- Function: `connect`
- Signature: `(root: TreeNode | None)  -> TreeNode | None`
- Primary pattern: **Tree**

## Constraints

- `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 6000].`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0117"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
struct Node {{
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}}
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
