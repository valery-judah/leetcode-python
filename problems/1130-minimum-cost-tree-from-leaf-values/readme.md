# 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/)
- Function: `mctFromLeafValues`
- Signature: `(arr: list[int])  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Stack**

## Constraints

- `2 <= arr.length <= 40`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 15`
- `It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (i.e., it is less than 2^31).`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1130"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation: There are two possible trees shown.
The first has a non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [4,11]
Output: 44
```
