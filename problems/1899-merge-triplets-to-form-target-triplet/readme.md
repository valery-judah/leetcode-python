# 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet

## Quick Facts

- URL:
  [Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-triplets-to-form-target-triplet/)
- Function: `mergeTriplets`
- Signature: `(triplets: list[list[int]], target: list[int])  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Greedy**

## Constraints

- `1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5`
- `triplets[i].length == target.length == 3`
- `1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000`

## Problem Crux (1–2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1899"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the third triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].
- Choose the third and fourth triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the fourth triplet to be [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(5,3)] = [5,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,5,5]].
The target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.
