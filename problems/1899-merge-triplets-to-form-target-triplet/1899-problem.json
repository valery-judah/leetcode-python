  "content": "<p>A <strong>triplet</strong> is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array <code>triplets</code>, where <code>triplets[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> <strong>triplet</strong>. You are also given an integer array <code>target = [x, y, z]</code> that describes the <strong>triplet</strong> you want to obtain.</p>\n\n<p>To obtain <code>target</code>, you may apply the following operation on <code>triplets</code> <strong>any number</strong> of times (possibly <strong>zero</strong>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Choose two indices (<strong>0-indexed</strong>) <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> (<code>i != j</code>) and <strong>update</strong> <code>triplets[j]</code> to become <code>[max(a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>j</sub>), max(b<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>), max(c<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub>)]</code>.\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For example, if <code>triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3]</code> and <code>triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5]</code>, <code>triplets[j]</code> will be updated to <code>[max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5]</code>.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <code>true</code> <em>if it is possible to obtain the </em><code>target</code><em> <strong>triplet</strong> </em><code>[x, y, z]</code><em> as an<strong> element</strong> of </em><code>triplets</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Perform the following operations:\n- Choose the first and last triplets [<u>[2,5,3]</u>,[1,8,4],<u>[1,7,5]</u>].

But I didn\\'t get the idea until I didn\\'t check the discussion tab. Also, if this qsn comes in an interview, How will we figure out that its a greedy one ? My natural instinct will take me to sorting then initializing pointers to each array kind of thing and then I will be lost there. Any thought would be appreciated. Thankyou :D\\n",
