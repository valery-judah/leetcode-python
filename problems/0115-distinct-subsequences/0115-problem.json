The description says you're supposed to return 3 for that, but don't indicate what the three distinct subsequences are.\\n\\nBy their definition of subsequence, it seems like the answer should be much larger, as T has the following subsequences, all of which are in T:\\n\\n\"r\" \"ra\" \"rab\" \"rabb\" \"a\" \"ab\" \"abb\" \"b\" \"bb\" \"bbi\" \"bbit\" \"bi\" \"bit\" \"i\" \"it\" \"t\"\\n\\nAnd I'm not even sure that list is complete. But, it's way more than 3. They must be using a very particular definition of 'distinct', as all of those subsequences look distinct to me.\\n\\nCan we get a clarification?
