The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Insertion-sort-example-300px.gif\" style=\"height:180px; width:300px\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/sort1linked-list.jpg\" style=\"width: 422px; height: 222px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> head = [4,2,1,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,3,4]\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/sort2linked-list.jpg\" style=\"width: 542px; height: 222px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> head = [-1,5,3,4,0]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [-1,0,3,4,5]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[1, 5000]</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>-5000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 5000</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
