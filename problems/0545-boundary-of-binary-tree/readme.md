# 0545. Boundary of Binary Tree

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Boundary of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/boundary-of-binary-tree/)
- Function: `boundaryOfBinaryTree`
- Signature: `(root: TreeNode | None)  -> list[int]`
- Primary pattern: **Tree**

## Constraints

- `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0545"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 2 -> 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [2].
- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's left child 2 -> 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the left boundary is [2].
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 3 -> 6 -> 10.
  10 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [3,6], and in reverse order is [6,3].
- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
```
