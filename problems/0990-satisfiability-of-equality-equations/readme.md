# 0990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/)
- Function: `equationsPossible`
- Signature: `(equations: list[str])  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Graph**

## Constraints

- `1 <= equations.length <= 500`
- `equations[i].length == 4`
- `equations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.`
- `equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'.`
- `equations[i][2] is '='.`
- `equations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0990"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

None

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```
