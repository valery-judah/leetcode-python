You are correct to identify that decoupling the preprocessing step is often a good practice. It aligns with the **Separation of Concerns** principle, which advocates for breaking down a problem into distinct, manageable parts. However, in the context of algorithm optimization (especially in interviews), this choice involves a significant trade-off.

Here is a systematic analysis of the pros and cons of decoupling in this specific problem:

### **Arguments for Decoupling (The "Good")**

1. **Readability and Maintainability:** The code is objectively cleaner and easier to understand. There are two distinct, sequential steps:

   - `cleaned = clean_string(s)`
   - `check_palindrome(cleaned)`
     This makes the logic for each part simpler to reason about, test, and debug. The palindrome-checking loop, as you noted, becomes trivial.

1. **Reusability:** The `clean_string` function is a self-contained, reusable utility. If another part of the application needed to sanitize strings in the same way, that function could be used directly.

1. **Reduced Complexity in Core Logic:** The integrated (O(1) space) approach combines three concerns into one loop: finding the next valid left character, finding the next valid right character, and comparing them. This intertwining of logic increases the cognitive load and the potential for bugs (e.g., infinite loops, incorrect pointer advancement). The decoupled approach isolates these concerns.

### **Arguments Against Decoupling (The "Bad")**

1. **Space Complexity (The Primary Drawback):** This is the most critical factor in an algorithmic context. Decoupling requires the creation of a new string to store the sanitized version. This results in **O(n) auxiliary space complexity**, where `n` is the number of alphanumeric characters. For very large strings or in memory-constrained environments, this is highly inefficient. The integrated approach achieves the optimal **O(1) auxiliary space**.

1. **Performance (Time Complexity Nuance):** While both methods are O(n) in time, the decoupled approach must always iterate through the entire string at least once to build the new `cleaned` string. The integrated approach, however, can **short-circuit**. If it finds a mismatch early on (e.g., `"race a car"`), it returns `false` immediately without processing the rest of the string. The decoupled approach would first build `"raceacar"` and only then find the mismatch.

### **Synthesis and Conclusion**

Whether decoupling is "good" depends entirely on the optimization priorities:

| Priority | Preferred Approach | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Space & Time Efficiency** | **Integrated (Coupled)** | This is the optimal solution from a pure performance standpoint. It uses constant extra memory and has the potential for early termination. In a coding interview or performance-critical application, this is almost always the expected and superior answer. |
| **Readability & Maintainability** | **Decoupled (Pre-processed)** | This is the better solution from a software engineering and code clarity perspective. If the input strings are known to be small and performance is not the primary constraint, this approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable code. |

**In conclusion:** While decoupling is a valuable software engineering principle, it comes at the cost of space efficiency in this problem. The integrated, O(1) space solution is considered algorithmically superior because it solves the problem within stricter performance constraints, which is a primary focus of platforms like LeetCode and technical interviews.
