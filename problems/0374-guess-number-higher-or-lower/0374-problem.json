Given  a upper bound ```n``` this function should guess the correct number picked between ```1``` and ```n```.\\n\\nTo help you with the guessing you are provided with an API ```guess()```. You pass in the value that you have <i>guessed</i> and this function will return 3 values depending upon whether the guess is right or wrong :\\n```-1``` if the number guessed is higher than the picked number\\n```1``` if the number guessed is lower than the picked number\\notherwise return ```0``` when the number guessed  is equal to picked number.\\n\\nBased upon this you\\'re to formulate  a strategy so that you can zero in on the picked number.\\n\\nHappy leetcoding :)\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nHint :- try binary search maybe?",
