But I think the combination of reversal + merging operations during an interview settting makes this problem on the harder end of medium problems. This, coupled with the fact you have to recognize that in order to get the new order, you have to reverse the second half, then merge the two halves. IDK, seems hard to do in 45 minutes. Took me 10 minutes to figure out the pattern, and 40 minutes to code.",
