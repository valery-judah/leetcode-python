## Quick Facts

- URL:
  [Largest Number At Least Twice of Others](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/)
- Function: `dominantIndex`
- Signature: `(nums: list[int])  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Sorting**

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `The largest element in nums is unique.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0747"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
```
