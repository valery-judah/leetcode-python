If you tried to do it using pure conditionals, which I did for the first 3 hours, you\\'re in for a very bad time. I finally gave up on conditionals when it had a nested within nested case. I was about to go 3d array to store each set but it was so logically complex I almost quit. Then I saw it. So this problem could considered medium if you didn\\'t see the easy answer. Overall, a very clever question. It had so many caveats that I kept getting rejected and it was giving me pstd by the end. lol.

If the length is odd, the function returns false because it means that the brackets are not properly balanced.\\nThe next line creates an empty stack of characters to store the opening brackets.\\nThe function then loops through each character item in the input string s.\\nFor each character item, the code checks whether it is an opening bracket: (, [, or {. If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false.",
