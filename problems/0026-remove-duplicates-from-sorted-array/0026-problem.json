  "content": "<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, remove the duplicates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>in-place</strong></a> such that each unique element appears only <strong>once</strong>.
