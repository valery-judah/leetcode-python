If we scan the grid from coordinate (0,0) to coordinate (n-1 ,n-1) going from top to bottom, left to right, then we are guaranteed to always enter each land mass from the top left corner. Now given we have entered two different land masses from the top left corner, can you determine if these two land masses are the same? How about if we use strings to mark traversal path?
