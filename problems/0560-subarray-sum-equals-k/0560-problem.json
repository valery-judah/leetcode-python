As I understand of the question, \"the total number of continuous subarrays\" means **how many numbers in subarrays which Sum is K**, but this questions really meaning is **how many subarrays which sum is K** . After I carefully read the questions, I found a \"s\" in word \"subarrays\" that may indicate this question ask me to find plural subarrays which means how many subarrays. \\n\\nIf the question use count how many subarrays instead of find total number of subarrays, it will be much better.
