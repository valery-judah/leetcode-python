# 0642. Design Search Autocomplete System

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Design Search Autocomplete System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-search-autocomplete-system/)
- Function: ``
- Signature: `(inputs: list[int], inputs: list[int])  -> list[str]`
- Primary pattern: **Heap (Priority Queue)**

## Constraints

- `n == sentences.length`
- `n == times.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= times[i] <= 50`
- `c is a lowercase English letter, a hash '#', or space ' '.`
- `Each tested sentence will be a sequence of characters c that end with the character '#'.`
- `Each tested sentence will have a length in the range [1, 200].`
- `The words in each input sentence are separated by single spaces.`
- `At most 5000 calls will be made to input.`

## Problem Crux (1–2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0642"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input
["AutocompleteSystem", "input", "input", "input", "input"]
[[["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]], ["i"], [" "], ["a"], ["#"]]
Output
[null, ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"], ["i love you", "i love leetcode"], [], []]

Explanation
AutocompleteSystem obj = new AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]);
obj.input("i"); // return ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"]. There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.
obj.input(" "); // return ["i love you", "i love leetcode"]. There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
obj.input("a"); // return []. There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
obj.input("#"); // return []. The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.
