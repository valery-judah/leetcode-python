Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?",
