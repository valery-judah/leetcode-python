# 0484. Find Permutation

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Find Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-permutation/)
- Function: `findPermutation`
- Signature: `(s: str)  -> list[int]`
- Primary pattern: **Stack**

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i] is either 'I' or 'D'.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0484"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "I"
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: [1,2] is the only legal permutation that can represented by s, where the number 1 and 2 construct an increasing relationship.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "DI"
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: Both [2,1,3] and [3,1,2] can be represented as "DI", but since we want to find the smallest lexicographical permutation, you should return [2,1,3]
```
