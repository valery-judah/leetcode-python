This corresponds to n=8n=8n=8. Thus, the minimum permutation possible will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Now, to satisfy the first two \"DD\" pattern, we can observe that the best course of action to generate the smallest arrangement will be to rearrange only 1, 2, 3, because these are the smallest numbers that can be placed at the three most significant positions to generate the smallest arrangement satisfying the given pattern till now, leading to the formation of [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] till now. We can note that placing any number larger than 3 at any of these positions will lead to the generation of a lexicographically larger arrangement as discussed above.\n",
