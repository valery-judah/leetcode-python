I may have been misled by initial intuition which was to find the maximum of each row and the maximum of each column.  That gives me *part* of the surface area visible from x and y.  I developed a complex way of counting the surface area not visible from x and y.  The surface area of z is just the count of nonzero values * 2.\\n\\nI have read others\\' solution and, in hindsight, they are much more straight forward.  Essentially, compute the surface area of each grid but substract the overlapping areas.\\n\\n",
