# 1681. Minimum Incompatibility

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Minimum Incompatibility](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-incompatibility/)
- Function: `minimumIncompatibility`
- Signature: `(nums: list[int], k: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Dynamic Programming**

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 16`
- `nums.length is divisible by k`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1681"`

## Common Pitfalls

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2] and [1,4].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.
Note that [1,1] and [2,4] would result in a smaller sum, but the first subset contains 2 equal elements.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,2], k = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2], [2,3], [6,8], and [1,3].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (3-2) + (8-6) + (3-1) = 6.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [5,3,3,6,3,3], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to distribute nums into 3 subsets where no two elements are equal in the same subset.
```
