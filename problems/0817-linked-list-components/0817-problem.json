For example, take the test case:\\nhead = [1,2,0,4,3]\\nnums = [3,4,0,2,1]\\nWhen you traverse the list you find that every element you traverse consecutively is present in nums, hence the answer is 1.\\nIf 5 was added say in between 0 and 4:\\nhead = [1,2,0,5,4,3]\\n1,2,0 appear consecutively and are present in nums but 5 separates 0 and 4. So 0 and 4 are not consecutive this time. But 4,3 are consecutive and are present in nums. So we have two consecutive components and hence our answer is 2.\\n",

In the graph if there is only one node separate from every other node then it is counted 1. if there are n number of nodes connected with each-other then it is also counted as 1.\\nOnly difference is that in our ques connection of elements is linear while in the graph connection of nodes is multi-dimensional and we are looking for elements in list which are present in array.\\nI hope it will help you.",
