# 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Greatest Common Divisor Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-traversal/)
- Function: `canTraverseAllPairs`
- Signature: `(nums: list[int])  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Math**

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2709"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: true
Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [3,9,5]
Output: false
Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [4,3,12,8]
Output: true
Explanation: There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.
