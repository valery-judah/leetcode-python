  "content": "<p>You are given an array of integers <code>stones</code> where <code>stones[i]</code> is the weight of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone.</p>\n\n<p>We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the <strong>heaviest two stones</strong> and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with <code>x &lt;= y</code>. The result of this smash is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If <code>x == y</code>, both stones are destroyed, and</li>\n\t<li>If <code>x != y</code>, the stone of weight <code>x</code> is destroyed, and the stone of weight <code>y</code> has new weight <code>y - x</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, there is <strong>at most one</strong> stone left.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the weight of the last remaining stone</em>.
