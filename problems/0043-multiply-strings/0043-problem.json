This problem is extremely useful and has real-world applications, such as in calculators. The reason involves with the overflow issue.\n\nLet's take an example with C/C++. You will certainly fail at this problem if you represent those strings using the largest data type, i.e., \"long long\" with a MAX_VAL of 9223372036854775807. Converting \"string number\" to \"long number\" or \"int number\" isn't how calculators operate in real life, as you can easily notice that all calculators nowadays can multiply numbers bigger than the long long MAX_VAL.\n\nThat's why the solution to perform multiplication with two string numbers manually comes into play.",
