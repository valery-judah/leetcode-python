For example, in [2, 3, 6, 7] tar = 7, the value 2 has the choice between picking itself or any number in front of it, which is why [2, 2, 3] is an answer but, the value 3 will never be able to choose 2 so the result [3, 2, 2] is not possible (hopefully I explained it clearly).**\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5c439987-250b-4f89-ae36-8d7428f25b68_1611079433.9667132.png)\\n\\n",

Another post says `O(l^k)` -  where `l` is the length of the array, `k` is the length of the longest possible combination (namely `target / minInArray`). I do not understand why this is the case using the backtracking approach. Could anyone give a detailed explination and analysis on the time and space complexity? Thanks!",
