The path can only move down or right at each step.**\\n\\n- We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. We will create a 2D array dp of the same size as the input grid, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum from the top-left corner to cell (i, j).\\n\\n- We can initialize the dp array as follows:\\n\\n1. dp[0][0] = grid[0][0] since the minimum path sum to the top-left corner is the value of the top-left cell.\\n2. For the first row i=0 and first column j=0 < j < n, the minimum path sum can only be reached by moving right or down from the previous cell. So, we can compute dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j] and dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0] respectively.\\n3. For the rest of the cells, we can compute the minimum path sum as follows:\\ndp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) since we can reach the current cell from the cell above or the cell to the left, and we want to take the path with the minimum sum.\\n- Once we have filled the dp array, the minimum path sum to the bottom-right corner will be dp[m-1][n-1], where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the input grid.\\n\\n**The time complexity of this approach is O(mn) since we visit each cell once. The space complexity is also O(mn) since we use the dp array to store the intermediate results.**",
