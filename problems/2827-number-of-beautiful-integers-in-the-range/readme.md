# 2827. Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-beautiful-integers-in-the-range/)
- Function: `numberOfBeautifulIntegers`
- Signature: `(low: int, high: int, k: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Dynamic Programming**

## Constraints

- `0 < low <= high <= 10^9`
- `0 < k <= 20`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2827"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: low = 10, high = 20, k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful integers in the given range: [12,18].
- 12 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
- 18 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
Additionally we can see that:
- 16 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 3.
- 15 is not beautiful because it does not contain equal counts even and odd digits.
It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful integers in the given range.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: low = 1, high = 10, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 beautiful integer in the given range: [10].
- 10 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 1.
It can be shown that there is only 1 beautiful integer in the given range.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: low = 5, high = 5, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 0 beautiful integers in the given range.
- 5 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 2 and it does not contain equal even and odd digits.
```
