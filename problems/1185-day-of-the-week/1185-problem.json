Here\\'s how it works:\\n\\n1. If the month is January or February, we add 12 to the month and subtract 1 from the year.\\n\\n2. We calculate the year, century, and decade using the formulas:\\n year_of_century = year % 100 \\ncentury = year // 100\\ndecade = month.\\n\\n3. We calculate the weekday using the formula:\\nweekday = (day + (13 * (decade + 1) // 5) + year_of_century + (year_of_century // 4) + (century // 4) - (2 * century)) % 7\\n\\n4. We use the following table to convert the weekday number to the corresponding day of the week:\\n0 -> \"Sunday\"\\n1 -> \"Monday\"\\n2 -> \"Tuesday\"\\n3 -> \"Wednesday\"\\n4 -> \"Thursday\"\\n5 -> \"Friday\"\\n6 -> \"Saturday\" ",
