This quickly provides us with a solution that significantly outperforms brute-force.\\n2) As a result of the above, we only need to try string lengths up to the length of the shorter of our two input strings. This gives us our bounds for determining candidate string lengths.\\n3) Since we are looking for the longest candidate we can begin our iteration from the largest string length that evenly divides both strings and work downward to smaller length strings. The first string that fits our criteria is then our answer.",
