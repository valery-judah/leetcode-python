# 0422. Valid Word Square

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Valid Word Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-square/)
- Function: `validWordSquare`
- Signature: `(words: list[str])  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Array**

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 500`
- `words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0422"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: words = ["abcd","bnrt","crmy","dtye"]
Output: true
Explanation:
The 1st row and 1st column both read "abcd".
The 2nd row and 2nd column both read "bnrt".
The 3rd row and 3rd column both read "crmy".
The 4th row and 4th column both read "dtye".
Therefore, it is a valid word square.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: words = ["abcd","bnrt","crm","dt"]
Output: true
Explanation:
The 1st row and 1st column both read "abcd".
The 2nd row and 2nd column both read "bnrt".
The 3rd row and 3rd column both read "crm".
The 4th row and 4th column both read "dt".
Therefore, it is a valid word square.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: words = ["ball","area","read","lady"]
Output: false
Explanation:
The 3rd row reads "read" while the 3rd column reads "lead".
Therefore, it is NOT a valid word square.
```
