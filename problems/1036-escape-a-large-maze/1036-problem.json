Whether we have reached target\\n    2. Whether we have exceeded 200 distance, here distance is calculated using manhattan distance, |(diff of x)| + |(diff of y)|\\nIf any of above is true, then return result true.\\n\\nBut wait, what if blocked points are not trying to surround source point but have surrounded the target point?\\n\\nFor above, scenario we again do a bfs bt this time from target to source, if we are able to reach now , we return true.\\n\\nOnly if both traversal return true then we can truly escape.............\\n\\nAlso first check should be whether the src/target point lie on blocked list if yes, then escape is impossible\\n",

So, you need to understand this simple point\\n\\n\" A closed polygon made of n boundary points (in this case, n \\u2264 200) can enclose at most \\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 \"\\nIn case of 200, what you get is 19900\\n\\nThis statement might be confusing, let me break it down for you. If you start at source, what will be the worst case in reaching the target? All the ways are in blocked. i.e, there is a circle of blocked points waiting for you. But as we use manhattan distance instead of eucledian, it may be some other shape.\\n\\nAnyways, in that worst case, the atmost blocked coordinates can be 200 (mentioned in constraints). So, in order to reach the circle in worst case, you need 19900 steps. i.e, with source as centre and radius as 19900, you\\'ll reach the circle\\'s border. If you have exceeded 19900, then you can directly reach target\\n\\nHINT : Similarly apply BFS from target in order to check for the circle around you \\n\\nHappy leetcoding :)",
