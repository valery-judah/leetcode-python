# 1036. Escape a Large Maze

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Escape a Large Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-a-large-maze/)
- Function: `isEscapePossible`
- Signature: `(blocked: list[list[int]], source: list[int], target: list[int])  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Hash Table**

## Constraints

- `0 <= blocked.length <= 200`
- `blocked[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi, yi < 10^6`
- `source.length == target.length == 2`
- `0 <= sx, sy, tx, ty < 10^6`
- `source != target`
- `It is guaranteed that source and target are not blocked.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1036"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

None

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: blocked = [[0,1],[1,0]], source = [0,0], target = [0,2]
Output: false
Explanation: The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square because we cannot move.
We cannot move north or east because those squares are blocked.
We cannot move south or west because we cannot go outside of the grid.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: blocked = [], source = [0,0], target = [999999,999999]
Output: true
Explanation: Because there are no blocked cells, it is possible to reach the target square.
```
