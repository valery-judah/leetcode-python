# 2479. Maximum XOR of Two Non-Overlapping Subtrees

## Quick Facts

- URL:
  [Maximum XOR of Two Non-Overlapping Subtrees](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-non-overlapping-subtrees/)
- Function: `maxXor`
- Signature: `(n: int, edges: list[list[int]], values: list[int])  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Graph**

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `values.length == n`
- `1 <= values[i] <= 10^9`
- `It is guaranteed that edges represents a valid tree.`

## Problem Crux (1–2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2479"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5]], values = [2,8,3,6,2,5]
Output: 24
Explanation: Node 1's subtree has sum of values 16, while node 2's subtree has sum of values 8, so choosing these nodes will yield a score of 16 XOR 8 = 24. It can be proved that is the maximum possible score we can obtain.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], values = [4,6,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no possible way to select two non-overlapping subtrees, so we just return 0.
```
