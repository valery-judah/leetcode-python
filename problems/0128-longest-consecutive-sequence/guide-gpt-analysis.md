# **1) Diagnosis of your logic**

- **Strong starts**
    - Correctly identifies the core operation: fast membership → use a hash set.

    - Spots the flaw in “scan from global minimum”: the numeric range is huge, so “what’s next?” over ℤ is
      intractable.

    - Explicitly calls out the key predicate: “x is a start iff x-1 ∉ set.”

- **Gaps / corrections**
    - **Complexity misstatement:** “Brute force is O(n!)” is incorrect here. Common baselines are:
        - Sort + scan: O(n log n) time, O(1) extra if in-place.

        - Un-pruned set walk from every element: worst-case O(n^2) (re-walking tails), not factorial.

    - **Iteration domain not nailed down early:** You hint at it; make it explicit: iterate over **observed
      values** only (the set), never over a numeric interval.

    - **Redundancy audit not formalized:** You see the symptom. Name the rule that kills it: “only start at
      numbers without predecessors.”

# **2) Diagnosis of Gemini’s proposal**

- **Strengths**
    - Clear **naive → failure → aha → rule** cadence.

    - The “start if and only if no predecessor” rule is front and center.

    - Explains the greedy flavor: eliminate middle elements by definition.

- **Gaps**
    - Light on a correctness invariant (why every maximal run is visited exactly once).

    - Light on duplicates and dedup strategy when describing the sorting oracle.

    - Skips iteration-domain language (‘values vs range’), which is your sticking point.

# **3) Merged heuristics that bridge your gap**

- **Redundant-work audit:** If you walk from every x, you recompute tails x+1, x+2, …. Kill this by filtering
  to **starts** only.

- **Start-of-work-unit heuristic:** A work unit = one maximal consecutive block. Unique start property: x is a
  start ⇔ x-1 ∉ S. Check is O(1).

- **Iteration-domain shift:** Loop over the **set of given numbers** S, not over [min(nums), max(nums)].

# **4) Corrected complexity map**

- Sorting + scan: O(n log n) time, O(1) extra (in-place) or O(n) (copy). Correct, simple.

- Set with “starts only”: expected O(n) time, O(n) space. Each element participates in ≤1 forward walk.

- “Brute” set walk from every element: O(n^2) in a single long run.

# **5) Plain-English correctness you can say**

- **Dominance/exchange:** If x-1 ∈ S, then any run that includes x is also discovered from x-1. Starting from
  x would duplicate work. So only x with x-1 ∉ S can start a new, undiscovered run.

- **Loop invariant:** When growing from a start x, at step k the pointer sits at x+k and all x, …, x+k-1 are
  in S. The loop stops exactly when x+L ∉ S. No other start can claim a member of this run because every
  interior z has z-1 ∈ S.

# **6) Your notes, upgraded (interview bullets)**

- Goal: longest length of consecutive integers; order irrelevant; duplicates don’t help.

- I want O(1) membership → build S = set(nums).

- Naive from every element risks re-walking tails → worst O(n^2).

- Redundancy fix: process a block **once** from its unique smallest element.

- Start test: x is a start iff x-1 ∉ S. This is O(1).

- For each start, increment y = x, x+1, … while y ∈ S. Length = y - x.

- Track max. Each element belongs to exactly one forward walk → expected O(n) time.

- Sorting oracle exists: O(n log n); useful for tests and as a first cut.

- Duplicates: set removes them; they don’t extend runs.

- Handles negatives and zero identically.

# **7) Drop-in “Discovery Path” (merged style)**

- **Initial observation.** We need runs like …, k, k+1, …. Only membership matters.

- **Naive idea & failure mode.** Sort and line-scan to count runs. Correct but O(n log n). If we instead walk
  forward from **every** number using a set, we re-walk tails → O(n^2) in a single long run.

- **Aha!** Each maximal run has a **unique smallest element**. We can find it with a constant-time predicate:
  x is a start iff x-1 is **not** present.

- **Rule.** Build S = set(nums). For each x ∈ S, **only** if x-1 ∉ S, walk y = x, x+1, … while y ∈ S; update
  best with y - x.

- **Micro-walkthrough.** [100,4,200,1,3,2] → S={…}. Starts: 100 (no 99), 1 (no 0), 200 (no 199). Lengths:
  100→1, 1→4 (1,2,3,4), 200→1. Answer 4. We never start at 2,3,4 since each has a predecessor.

# **8) Common pitfalls to preempt**

- Misstating brute-force as O(n!) here. The bad path is O(n^2).

- Iterating over the full [min, max] range. Iterate over observed values only.

- Forgetting to filter to starts → repeated tails and quadratic time.

- Off-by-one on length. After loop, length is y - x, not y - x + 1.

- Mutating the set during iteration. Iterate over a fixed S.

# **9) Optional Socratic prompts (if you want coaching)**

- If you start from every element, which sub-work gets repeated?

- Can you define a property that only the **first** element in a run has?

- How do you test that property in O(1) with a set?

- What are you iterating over: indices, value range, or observed values?

- Why does this guarantee each run is processed exactly once?

This covers your reasoning, Gemini’s narrative, and the minimal set of heuristics and proofs to connect them.
