      "content": "I didn\\'t pass this, but idea: let `ans(i, j)` be the number of ways to insert commas into `nums[j:]`, with the restriction that the resulting list is nondecreasing and contain elements `>= int(nums[i:j])`. The recurrence is\\n\\n`ans(i, j) = (nums[i:j] <= nums[j:k] ? ans(i, k) : 0) + ans(j, k+1) + ans(j, k+2) + ...` where `i+j == j+k`. Basically, of all the ways to insert the first comma into `nums[j:]`, most of them will either obviously fail because the resulting first number is shorter than `num[i:j]`, or obviously work for similar reason, and there is one case where it\\'s excatly the same length.\\n\\nAs written, each DP state depends on `O(N)` other, but we can introduce a function `ans_sum(i, j) = ans(i, j) + ans(i, j+1) + ...` (pretty standard DP trick). Now we rewrite:\\n\\n`ans(i, j) = (nums[i:j] <= nums[j:k] ? ans(i, k) : 0) + ans_sum(j, k+1)`\\n`ans_sum(i, j) = ans(i, j) + ans_sum(i, j+1)`\\n\\n(ignoring some terminating conditions). I guess many people got to this point, unfortunately, the computation `nums[i:j] <= nums[j:k]` is not constant time if done naively. But with preprocessing with suffix array / suffix tree, it can be done in `O(1)` time. Also string hashing (like in rabin-karp) + binary search in `O(log N)`. Maybe this is enough?",
