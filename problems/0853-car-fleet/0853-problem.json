The position give is nearer to destination . eg: if pos = 8 it is just 4 unit away from destination ie 12. and time taken can be calculated by (float)(target - pos)/speed.\\n2. Whether 2 car will collide or not . It can be found by comparing a time taken by cars to reach a destination.\\n3. You should sort the cars on the basis of their position but  NOTE: that you need both the speed and position to calculate the time taken by each car to reach destination.\\n4. Last thing which you will be needing is the stack so that you can compare the time taken by the cars and perform some operations based your requirement. \\n!!!!  UPVOTE IF IT HELPED !!!!!!",
