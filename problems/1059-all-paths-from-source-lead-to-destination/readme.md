# 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination

## Quick Facts

- URL:
  [All Paths from Source Lead to Destination](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-lead-to-destination/)
- Function: `leadsToDestination`
- Signature: `(n: int, edges: list[list[int]], source: int, destination: int)  -> bool`
- Primary pattern: **Graph**

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^4`
- `edges.length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `0 <= source <= n - 1`
- `0 <= destination <= n - 1`
- `The given graph may have self-loops and parallel edges.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1059"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true
```
