I had to run it manually with multiple different custom test cases to find out the pattern. Was a huge waste of time.\\nIf the pattern / working of the pattern is described properly, it becomes a \"SIMPLE\" problem, since you only have to code the pattern. This must be a coding question, not finding out the secret pattern question. Cos if it is \"find the secret pattern\" question, then it should be tagged as such and annotated as a \"MEDIUM\" problem.",

Similar to Roman numerals, where 0 does not exist. I.E. X = 10. XI = 11.\\n\\nIn a base10 system, 58 is \\n10 * 5 + 8.\\n58 is represented by the sixth digit, and the ninth digit in the base10 system where 0 does exist.\\n\\nIn base26 system, the number 58 is actually\\n26 * 2 + 6. \\nTherefore, it is represented by the second letter + the sixth letter, which is \\'BF\\' in this case.\\n\\nConclusively, we can keep modding/dividing to get the last character in the base26 system.\\n",
