But still to do it again after 2 weeks, I need to rewatch the videos. In fact, in one of the videos, the youtuber told that no interviewer should ask such a question in an interview.\\n\\nSo I cannot understand how it was aksed so many times in Amazon.\\n\\nCould someone please share an experience when this question was asked?",

According to this problem description, I would say [1,3] is a \"critical connection\" because without it, the above two loops can not reach each. However, by using topological sorting, since all nodes are in at least one loop, it will give empty result.\\nIs my thinking correct?",
