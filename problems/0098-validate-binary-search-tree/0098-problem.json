It can be worked around just by changing all your Integers to Longs and seems like it exists solely to be a pointless roadblock. If you are going to have a test case with this value, why not have one with the value of -4,294,967,295 and increase the scope of the problem tenfold. Its almost like all data types have limitations. This testcase benefits nobody, and should be removed.",
