  "content": "<p>There are <code>n</code> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is <code>gas[i]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p>\n\n<p>Given two integer arrays <code>gas</code> and <code>cost</code>, return <em>the starting gas station&#39;s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return</em> <code>-1</code>. If there exists a solution, it is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be <strong>unique</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nStart at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5.

Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\nYou cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\nTherefore, you can&#39;t travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>n == gas.length == cost.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= gas[i], cost[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n\t<li>The input is generated such that the answer is unique.</li>\n</ul>\n",

First just assum the gas tank can fall below zero, complete a loop starting at position 0, and record the index with lowest amount of gas (possibly negative) in tank, call it `lowest_idx`.\\n\\n2. Complete a loop starting from `lowest_idx`, break and return `-1` if the tank falls below zero at any point. Return `lowest_idx` if it never fell below zero.\\n\\nSure it\\'s not one pass, but extremely easy to understand, guarantees to be O(N) time and O(1) space, and did pass all tests.
