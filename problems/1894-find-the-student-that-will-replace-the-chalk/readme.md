# 1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk

## Quick Facts

- URL:
  [Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/)
- Function: `chalkReplacer`
- Signature: `(chalk: list[int], k: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Binary Search**

## Constraints

- `chalk.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= chalk[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1894"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25
Output: 1
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.
Student number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
