# 2472. Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings/)
- Function: `maxPalindromes`
- Signature: `(s: str, k: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Two Pointers**

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s consists of lowercase English letters.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2472"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "abaccdbbd". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.
```
