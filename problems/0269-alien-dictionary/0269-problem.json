It means that we don't need to care about the position of the letters without dependency, like x. The answer can be like xzy, zyx, zxy. As long as z is in front of y.\\n\\nBut for test case [\"wrtkj\",\"wrt\"], the expected answer is \"\". Interesting..\\naccording to test case [\"xz\",\"xy\"], the result of [\"wrtkj\",\"wrt\"] can be any order Coz there is no dependency of the letters.\\n\\nSome people says that because \"wrt\" is the prefix of \"wrtkj\", it should appear first. \\n\\nBut I think this question is called \"Alien Dictionary\" and there are no specific rules for the situation like \"wrtkj\", \"wrt\".\\nI may say that according to this \"Alien\" lexicography, \"a\" should appear after \"ab\", and \"ab\" should appear after \"aba\", that's totally possible, Coz it's allowed \"Alien\" lexicographically.\\n\\nI think if they want us to solve the problem based on the rule you mentioned, they should make it clear.\\n\\nIf I am wrong about this, please do let me know, thanks guys.",
