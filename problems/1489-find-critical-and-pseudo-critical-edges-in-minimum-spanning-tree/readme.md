## Quick Facts

- URL: [Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-critical-and-pseudo-critical-edges-in-minimum-spanning-tree/)
- Function: `findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges`
- Signature: `(n: int, edges: list[list[int]])  -> list[list[int]]`
- Primary pattern: **Graph**

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ai < bi < n`
- `1 <= weightiÂ <= 1000`
- `All pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1489"`

## Common Pitfalls

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.
```
