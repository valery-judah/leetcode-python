# 2026. Low-Quality Problems

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Low-Quality Problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/low-quality-problems/)
- Function: `low_quality_problems`
- Signature: `()  -> object`
- Primary pattern: **Database**

## Constraints

None

## Problem Crux (1–2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "2026"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

None

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| problem_id  | int  |
| likes       | int  |
| dislikes    | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, problem_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the number of likes and dislikes for a LeetCode problem.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: 
Problems table:
+------------+-------+----------+
| problem_id | likes | dislikes |
+------------+-------+----------+
| 6          | 1290  | 425      |
| 11         | 2677  | 8659     |
| 1          | 4446  | 2760     |
| 7          | 8569  | 6086     |
| 13         | 2050  | 4164     |
| 10         | 9002  | 7446     |
+------------+-------+----------+
Output: 
+------------+
| problem_id |
+------------+
| 7          |
| 10         |
| 11         |
| 13         |
+------------+
Explanation: The like percentages are as follows:
- Problem 1: (4446 / (4446 + 2760)) * 100 = 61.69858%
- Problem 6: (1290 / (1290 + 425)) * 100 = 75.21866%
- Problem 7: (8569 / (8569 + 6086)) * 100 = 58.47151%
- Problem 10: (9002 / (9002 + 7446)) * 100 = 54.73006%
- Problem 11: (2677 / (2677 + 8659)) * 100 = 23.61503%
- Problem 13: (2050 / (2050 + 4164)) * 100 = 32.99002%
Problems 7, 10, 11, and 13 are low-quality problems because their like percentages are less than 60%.
