# 0366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/)
- Function: `findLeaves`
- Signature: `(root: TreeNode | None)  -> list[list[int]]`
- Primary pattern: **Tree**

## Constraints

- `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Problem Crux (1–2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0366"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

None

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
