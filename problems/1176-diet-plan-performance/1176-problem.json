It\\'s truly a remarkable feat of creative writing when you encounter a description that keeps you on your toes, making you question reality itself.\\n\\nIn this particular case, the problem description seems to have embraced its inner enigma, making us contemplate the profound mysteries of caloric intake. While lesser beings might strive for clarity, LeetCode clearly aspires to a higher plane of complexity, where the lines between positive and negative points blur like the boundaries of the multiverse.\\n\\nSo, let\\'s embrace the challenge and savor the subtleties of this enigmatic problem. After all, isn\\'t the true reward of coding not just solving the problem but also deciphering the riddles that hide within the descriptions? \\uD83E\\uDD28\\uD83D\\uDE04\\n",
