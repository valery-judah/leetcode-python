Because in the description, it says there is **exactly one solution**. I will prove it here:\\n\\n1. Say we have three **N1** in the array like this [**N1**, N2, **N1**, N3, **N1**], then **N1** will not be part of the result with N2 or N3, since if **N1** is part of the result, then we have three solutions which go against the description. **N1** cannot be part of result with itself neither since then we have three solutions again. So in this case, we do not care duplicates at all.\\n\\n2. So the only possible situation that the **N1** can be the result is: **N1** *MUST* only have two of them, and the target *MUST* be **2 * N1**, then we have an array like this: [**N1**, N2, **N1**], and a target like this **2 * N1**. In this case, after building up the map, **N1**'s index will be the right most one which is 2. Then when we start from the first **N1** at index 0, we do (target - **N1**) and get **N1**, and then query the **N1**'s index in the array, which is 2, and then we can get the result which is [0, 2] with no problem.",
