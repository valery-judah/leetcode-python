# 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends

## Quick Facts

- URL: [The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-moment-when-everyone-become-friends/)
- Function: `earliestAcq`
- Signature: `(logs: list[list[int]], n: int)  -> int`
- Primary pattern: **Sorting**

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^4`
- `logs[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= timestampi <= 10^9`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
- `xi != yi`
- `All the values timestampi are unique.`
- `All the pairs (xi, yi) occur at most one time in the input.`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| # | Idea | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------------|------|-------|
| A | [primary idea] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n) | O(n) |
| B | [alternative] | [scenario] | [invariant] | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| C | [reject] | [why not] | [violated invariant] | - | - |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
  - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
  - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "1101"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101, and after 0 and 1 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104, and after 3 and 4 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107, and after 2 and 3 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211, and after 1 and 5 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224, and as 2 and 4 are already friends, nothing happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301, and after 0 and 3 become friends, we all become friends.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: At timestamp = 3, all the persons (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3) become friends.
```
