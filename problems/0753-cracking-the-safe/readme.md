# 0753. Cracking the Safe

## Quick Facts

- URL: [Cracking the Safe](https://leetcode.com/problems/cracking-the-safe/)
- Function: `crackSafe`
- Signature: `(n: int, k: int)  -> str`
- Primary pattern: **Graph**

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 4`
- `1 <= k <= 10`
- `1 <= k^n <= 4096`

## Problem Crux (1â€“2 sentences)

[state what must be detected/computed and key bound]

## Clarifying Questions (for interview)

- [input domain? ranges?]
- [edge-case semantics?]
- [any pair vs first pair? ties?]

## Reasoning Flow (notes-only)

[outline the logical steps that lead to the chosen approach]

## Approach Options

| #   | Idea           | When to use | Correctness invariant | Time       | Space |
| --- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| A   | [primary idea] | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n)       | O(n)  |
| B   | [alternative]  | [scenario]  | [invariant]           | O(n log n) | O(1)  |
| C   | [reject]       | [why not]   | [violated invariant]  | -          | -     |

## Edge Cases Checklist

- [case 1]
- [case 2]
- [case 3]

## Correctness Sketch

[state the invariant and why it guarantees correctness]

## Implementation

- `solutions.py` should expose:
    - `ALL_SOLUTIONS = {"...": fn, "...": fn}`
    - Short notes on tradeoffs and pitfalls.

## Tests

- Deterministic cases covering all edge cases above
- Optional fuzz/property checks as applicable
- Run: `pytest -q -k "0753"`

## Common Pitfalls

- [pitfall 1]
- [pitfall 2]
- [pitfall 3]

## Similar Problems

None

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "10"
Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "01100"
Explanation: For each possible password:
- "00" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.
- "01" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.
- "10" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.
- "11" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.
Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.
