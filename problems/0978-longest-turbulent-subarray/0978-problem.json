      "content": "The sliding window algorithm can be used to approach this solution, in which two pointers are used to keep track of the start and end of a window. In this method, the window should only keep valid a valid subarray (in which the subarray is turbulent).\\n\\nFirst, the case in which the array has only 0 or 1 element can be taken care of.\\n\\nThen, the window of the array can start with the first two elements.\\n- If the two consecutive elements are equal, the window can be readjusted so that the second repetitive element is the start of the window.\\n- Otherwise, we can include the third element to the subarray:\\n   - If the first element is less than the second and the second element is less than the third, the start of the window can be readjusted to point to the third element, to represent the start of a new subarray. Same goes for if the first element is greater than the second and the second element is greater than the third.\\n   - If the second element is less than the second and the second element is greater than the third, the maximum length of a turbulent subarray can be updated. Same goes for if the first element is greater than the second and the second element is less than the third.\\n\\nIn summary, only the last 3 elements within the window need to be analyzed for their sign relationships: the third to last must be compared to the second to last in order to determine what sign to expect for the second to last compared to the very last. This process can be repeated until the window reaches the end of the array.",
