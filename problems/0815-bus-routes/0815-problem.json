So the hint is to use **bus** as graph nodes and think how to determine if two buses are \"connected\", ie. they share at least 1 common bus stops.\n\nAfter that, find all the nodes you can start from (ie. all buses whose stops include `source`) and all the nodes you want to reach (ie. all buses whose stops include `target`). Then you can see a BFS coming into shape, remember to record the distance along the way. \n\nHopefully this makes the problem more approachable.",
