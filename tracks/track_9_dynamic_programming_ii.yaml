    # Grid & triangle tables
    - slug: unique-paths
      title: Unique Paths
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-grid-count
      section: grids
      why: >
          Classic grid count with 2D table or 1D roll. Base initialization and iteration order.
    - slug: unique-paths-ii
      title: Unique Paths II
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-grid-count-obstacles
      section: grids
      why: >
          Obstacles add zeroing and careful starts. Solidifies guard conditions.
    - slug: minimum-path-sum
      title: Minimum Path Sum
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-grid-min
      section: grids
      why: >
          Min over top/left with cell cost. Teaches sentinel handling and 1D rolling min.
    - slug: minimum-falling-path-sum
      title: Minimum Falling Path Sum
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-grid-min-diagonals
      section: grids
      why: >
          Down-left/down/down-right transition. Boundary guards and rolling from next row up.
    - slug: triangle
      title: Triangle
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-triangle
      section: grids
      why: >
          Bottom‑up row rolling or top‑down memo. Practises in‑place updates.

    # Edit/LCS family
    - slug: longest-common-subsequence
      title: Longest Common Subsequence
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-lcs
      section: edit-lcs
      why: >
          Canonical 2D DP. Transition on match vs skip. Sets template for many string DPs.
    - slug: edit-distance
      title: Edit Distance
      difficulty: hard
      primary_pattern: dp-levenshtein
      section: edit-lcs
      why: >
          Insert/delete/replace with cost 1. Full table with row/col bases and min of three.
    - slug: delete-operation-for-two-strings
      title: Delete Operation for Two Strings
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-lcs-derivation
      section: edit-lcs
      why: >
          Min deletions via |s|+|t|-2*LCS. Use LCS or direct DP. Highlights equivalences.
    - slug: interleaving-string
      title: Interleaving String
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-interleave
      section: edit-lcs
      why: >
          dp[i][j] depends on s1[i-1] or s2[j-1] matching s3. Indexing discipline with two sources.
    - slug: distinct-subsequences
      title: Distinct Subsequences
      difficulty: hard
      primary_pattern: dp-subsequence-count
      section: edit-lcs
      why: >
          Count subsequences forming T. Transition on match: take + skip. Requires large-number care.

    # Palindromes & substrings
    - slug: palindromic-substrings
      title: Palindromic Substrings
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-palindrome-table
      section: palindromes
      why: >
          2D table or expand‑around‑center. If dp, fill by length with dp[i+1][j-1] dependency.
    - slug: longest-palindromic-substring
      title: Longest Palindromic Substring
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-palindrome-table
      section: palindromes
      why: >
          Same table as 647 but track best length/span. Compares DP vs expand‑center tradeoffs.
    - slug: longest-palindromic-subsequence
      title: Longest Palindromic Subsequence
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-lps
      section: palindromes
      why: >
          LCS(s, reverse(s)) or direct dp[i][j]. Teaches reverse‑string trick vs in‑place 2D.
    - slug: maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray
      title: Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray
      difficulty: medium
      primary_pattern: dp-lcs-contiguous
      section: palindromes
      why: >
          LCS for contiguous runs. dp[i][j]=1+dp[i-1][j-1] on match; else 0. Contrast with LCS.

notes:
    ordering: Grids/triangle → LCS/edit family → interleaving/count → palindromes.

extensions:
    optional:
        - slug: maximal-square
          title: Maximal Square
          difficulty: medium
          primary_pattern: dp-grid-square
          section: grids
          why: >
              dp[i][j]=1+min of three neighbors for '1' cells. Area from side^2. Good rolling‑array practice.
        - slug: minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings
          title: Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings
          difficulty: medium
          primary_pattern: dp-ascii-delete
          section: edit-lcs
          why: >
              Weighted variant of 583. Requires sum of deleted char codes; careful base initialization.
        - slug: regular-expression-matching
          title: Regular Expression Matching
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-regex
          section: strings
          why: >
              DP with '.' and '*' operators. Edge‑case heavy; do after core tables.
        - slug: wildcard-matching
          title: Wildcard Matching
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-wildcard
          section: strings
          why: >
              Greedy+DP hybrid or full DP. Clarifies '*' collapse and consecutive wildcards.
        - slug: palindrome-partitioning-ii
          title: Palindrome Partitioning II
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-pal-partition
          section: palindromes
          why: >
              Precompute pal table then dp cuts. Classic O(n^2) preprocess + O(n^2) DP.
        - slug: dungeon-game
          title: Dungeon Game
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-grid-min-survival
          section: grids
          why: >
              Backward DP for min health needed. Teaches reverse fill with max(1, ...).
        - slug: minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick
          title: Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-interval-partition
          section: intervals
          why: >
              Interval DP with sorted cuts; cost depends on interval length + subproblems.
        - slug: burst-balloons
          title: Burst Balloons
          difficulty: hard
          primary_pattern: dp-interval-knuth-like
          section: intervals
          why: >
              Interval DP choosing last balloon to burst. High‑yield classic after interval DP intro.
