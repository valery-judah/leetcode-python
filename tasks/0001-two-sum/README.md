## Examples

- Add 2â€“3 examples and edge cases.

## Approach

The problem was solved using a hash map (`dict` in Python) to achieve an optimal single-pass solution. The algorithm iterates through the list of numbers, and for each number, it calculates the required complement to reach the target (`complement = target - num`).

- If the complement is already in the hash map, it means a solution has been found, and the indices of the complement and the current number are returned.
- If the complement is not in the map, the current number and its index are added to the map for future reference.

This approach avoids the need for a nested loop, which would result in an O(n^2) time complexity, and instead provides a more efficient O(n) solution.

## Complexity

- Time: O(n), because in the worst case, we will iterate through the entire list once.
- Space: O(n), because in the worst case, we will store all the numbers in the hash map.
