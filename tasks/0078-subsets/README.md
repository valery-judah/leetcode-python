# 78. Subsets

**URL**: https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/
**Difficulty**: medium
**Tags**: 

## Clarifying questions
- Input shape, ranges, constraints?
- Duplicates, negatives, empty input?
- Mutations allowed? Sorted? Streaming?

## Examples
- Add 2â€“3 examples and edge cases.

## Approach
- Brute force -> improved -> optimal.
- Data structures considered.
- Proof of correctness sketch.

## Complexity
- Time: O(...)
- Space: O(...)

## Checklist
- [ ] Restate problem
- [ ] Small example walkthrough
- [ ] Choose DS/algorithm
- [ ] Dry-run core loop
- [ ] Code cleanly
- [ ] Test edge cases

## Test Matrix Reporter
- Tests can opt into a colored PASS/FAIL matrix shown at the end of `pytest` by appending results to the shared `run_summary` fixture.
- For each assertion, append a tuple of `(label, ok)` where `label` is a short case name and `ok` is a boolean.
- Multi-solution tests should use the solution class name as the key. Example:

  ```python
  ok = S().solve(*args, **kwargs) == expected
  run_summary[S.__name__].append((label, ok))
  assert ok
  ```

- Single-solution tests (where `S` is an instance) should use the instance class name:

  ```python
  ok = S.solve(*args, **kwargs) == expected
  run_summary[S.__class__.__name__].append((label, ok))
  assert ok
  ```

- If more than 4 solutions exist, the table flips to list solutions as rows.
