# Assistant Instructions

## File Linking Convention

Files like `0169.soft.md` and `0169.hard.md` are not duplicate files. They are soft and hard links to the main readme file for a specific task (e.g., `tasks/0169-majority-element/readme.md`). This convention is used to provide stable and memorable links to task documentation, especially as the number of tasks grows.

When you encounter these files, treat them as pointers to the main readme file and not as separate, duplicated content.
